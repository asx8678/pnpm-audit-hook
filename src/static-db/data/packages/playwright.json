This can lead to full system compromise, as the downloaded files are installed as privileged applications.\n\n### Details\nThe following scripts in the `microsoft/playwright` repository at commit [`bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8) u",
