      "description": "## Impact\nThis vulnerability is a **command injection** issue.  \nWhen user-controlled input is passed into the `format` option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization.  \nAn attacker can craft malicious input such as:\n\n    { format: \"; echo vulnerable > /tmp/hello;\" }\n\nThis results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process.\n\n**Who is impacted:**  \nAny application that accepts untrusted input and forwards it directly ",
