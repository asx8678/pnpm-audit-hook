      "description": "### Summary\n\nThe `EMOJI_REGEX` used in the `emoji` action is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. A short, maliciously crafted string (e.g., <100 characters) can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time (minutes), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application.\n\n### Details\n\nThe ReDoS vulnerability stems from \"catastrophic backtracking\" in the `EMOJI_REGEX`. This is caused by ambiguity in the regex pattern due to overlapping character classes",
