      "description": "### Impact\nThe APIVersion rule uses `new Function()` to evaluate expression strings. A malicious crafted flow metadata file can cause arbitrary JavaScript execution during scanning. An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript during a scan by supplying a malicious expression within rule configuration or crafted flow metadata. This could compromise developer machines, CI runners, or editor environments.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch removes all uses of `new Function()` and replaces them with a safer ",
