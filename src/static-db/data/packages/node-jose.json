      "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this",

For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input.\n\n#### Technical summary\n\nThe JOSE logic implemented by `node-jose` usually relies on an external cryptographic library for the underlying cryptographic primitives that JOSE ",
