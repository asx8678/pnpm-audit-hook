This vulnerability could give total and complete access to a targeted Pod.\n\n#### Summary\nA verification flaw in the implementation of the identity token verifier library (https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier) allows DPoP proofs to be spoofed. \n\nDPoP proofs are used to bind access tokens ",
