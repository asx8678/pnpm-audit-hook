If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded.\n 2. If an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded.\n",
