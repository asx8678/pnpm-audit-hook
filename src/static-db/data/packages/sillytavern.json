      "description": "### Summary\nThe web UI for SillyTavern is susceptible to DNS rebinding, allowing attackers to perform actions like install malicious extensions, read chats, inject arbitrary HTML for phishing, etc.\n\n### Details\nDNS rebinding is a method to bypass the CORS policies by tricking the browser into resolving something like `127.0.0.1` for a site's DNS address. This allows anybody to get remote access to anyone's SillyTavern instance **without** it being exposed, just by visiting a website. \n\n### PoC\n1",
