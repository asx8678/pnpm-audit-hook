By embedding a misleading PACK signature within commit content and carefully constructing the packet structure, the attacker can trick the parser into treating invalid or unintended data as the packfile. Potentially, this would allow bypassing approval or hiding commits.\n\n### Details\nThe affected version of `parsePush.ts` attempts to locate the Git PACK file by looking for th",

Although these “hidden” commits never show up in the repository’s visible history, GitHub still serves them at their direct commit URLs.
