If your environment does **not** normalize incoming URLs (e.g., by collapsing multiple slashes), this can allow bypasses of `disabledPaths` and path-based rate limits.\n\n## Details\n\nBetter Auth uses **better-call**, which internally relies on **rou3** for routing. Affected versions of rou3 normalize paths by removing empty segments. As a result:\n\n* `/sign-in/email`\n* `/",
