This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/unpack.js`. When extracting a hardlink, two functions handle the linkpath differently:\n\n**Security",
