According to the corresponding RFC 6750, the bearer token has only base64 valid characters, reducing the range of characters for a brute force attack.\n\nAll versions of fastify-bearer-auth are also affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe released:\n\n* v8.0.1 with a fix for the Fastify v4 line\n* v7.0.2 with a fix for the Fastify v3 line\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere a",
