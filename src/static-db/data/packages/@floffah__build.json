      "description": "### Impact\nIf you are using the esbuild target or command you are at risk of code/option injection. Attackers can use the command line option to maliciously change your settings in order to damage your project.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in v1.0.0 as it uses a proper method to pass configs to esbuild/estrella.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no work around. You should update asap.\n\n### Notes\nThis notice is mainly just to make sure people update to the latest version. This isn't that bad",
