Improper application of CSP isn't itself a vulnerability, but it does fail to prevent XSS in the event that there is a viable attack vector for an XSS attack.\n\n### Impact\nThere aren't any XSS attack vectors via the Apollo Server landing pages _known to Apollo_, so to our knowledge there is no impact.
