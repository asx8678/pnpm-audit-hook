The parameter `requestURL` (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `<script>` block without sanitization or escaping.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.\n\nThe scope may be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used.\n\n### Patche",
