      "description": "### Impact\n\nIncorrect `number` DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute values in the range `2**31` -- `2**32 - 1`. The arithmetic in the `numBitLen` didn't take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon applying the `>>` operator, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nIn addition, `number` encoding had a few other issues that resulted it in it not encoding values correctly.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in version `1.0.4`. Users are recommended to",
