      "description": "There is a Stack Overflow vulnerability in eslint before 9.26.0 when serializing objects with circular references in `eslint/lib/shared/serialization.js`. The exploit is triggered via the `RuleTester.run()` method, which validates test cases and checks for duplicates. During validation, the internal function `checkDuplicateTestCase()` is called, which in turn uses the `isSerializable()` function for serialization checks. When a circular reference object is passed in, `isSerializable()` enters in",
