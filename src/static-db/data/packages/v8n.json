      "description": "### Impact\nInefficient regular expression complexity of `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex could lead to a denial of service attack. With a formed payload `'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A'`, only 32 characters payload could take 29443 ms time execution when testing `lowercase()`. The same issue happens with `uppercase()`.\n\n### Patches\nv1.5.1\n\n### References\n[huntr.dev report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/2d92f644-593b-43b4-bfd1-c8042ac60609)\n[_Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) and Catastrop",
