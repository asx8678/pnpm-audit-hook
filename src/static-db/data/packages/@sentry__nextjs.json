When `sendDefaultPii: true` was set, a few headers that were previously redacted - including Authorization and Cookie - were unintentionally allowed through.\n\nSentry’s server-side scrubbing (handled by Sentry's Relay edge proxy) normally serves as a second layer of protection. However, because it relied on the same matchin",
