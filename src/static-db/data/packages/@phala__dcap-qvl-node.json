      "description": "## Impact\nThis vulnerability involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl.\n\nThe library fetches QE Identity collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report.\n\n## Consequences\nAn attacker can forge the QE Identity data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting ",
