      "description": "TCR is temporarily miscalculated in the `batchLiquidateTroves` function during Recovery Mode.\n\nThe bug lies in [`batchLiquidateTroves` of `TroveManager`](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/7c83ea11378454629618b3808b16fbfda69ee3e5/packages/contracts/contracts/TroveManager.sol#L722). \n\nWhen calculating system's entire collateral, we should also exclude the liquidated trove's surplus collateral, since liquidation closes the trove and makes the surplus collateral claimable by the trove owner.
