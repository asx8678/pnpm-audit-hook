The initial value to seed the CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator) was baked-in to the final WebAssembly module meaning the sequence of numbers generated was predictable for that specific WebAssembly module. An attacker with access to that same WebAssembly module that calls the affected methods could use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated by these fu",
