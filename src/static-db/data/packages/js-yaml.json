      "description": "### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`). All users who parse untrusted yaml documents may be impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nProblem is patched in js-yaml 4.1.1 and 3.14.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can protect against this kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution protection is on by default).\n\n### Refe",
