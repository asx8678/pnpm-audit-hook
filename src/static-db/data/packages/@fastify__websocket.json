      "description": "### Impact\n\nAny application using @fastify/websocket could crash if a specific, malformed packet is sent. \n\nAll versions of fastify-websocket are also impacted. That module is deprecated, so it will not be patched.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in v7.1.1 (fastify v4) and v5.0.1 (fastify v3).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo known workaround is available. However, it should be possible to attach the error handler manually.\nThe recommended path is upgrading to the patched versions.\n\n## Credits\n\n[marcola",
