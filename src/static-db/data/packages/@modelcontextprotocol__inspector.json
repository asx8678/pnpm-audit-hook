      "description": "An XSS flaw exists in the MCP Inspector local development tool when it renders a redirect URL returned by a remote MCP server. If the Inspector connects to an untrusted server, a crafted redirect can inject script into the Inspector context and, via the built-in proxy, be leveraged to trigger arbitrary command execution on the developer machine. Version 0.16.6 hardens URL handling/validation and prevents script execution.\n\n> Thank you to the following researchers for their reports and contributi",
