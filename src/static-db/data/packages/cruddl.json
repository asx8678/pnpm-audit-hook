      "description": "### Impact\n\nIf a vunerable version of cruddl is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB.\n\nSchemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected.\n\nThe attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl.\n\n###",
