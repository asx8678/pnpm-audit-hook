This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Descripton\n\nThe `express-xss-sanitizer` package for Node.js has an unbounded recursion in the `sanitize` function (`lib/sanitize.js`) when processing JSON request bodies. A remote attacker can send a deeply nested payload to any endpoint that applies this sanitizer, driving excessive recursion and resource consumption (CPU)",
