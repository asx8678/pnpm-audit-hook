You may be affected if you execute `shell.exec()` in multi-user Mac, Linux, or WSL environments, or if you execute `shell.exec()` as the root user.\n\nOther shelljs functions (including the asynchronous version of `shell.exec()`) are not impacted.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in shelljs 0.8.5\n\n### Workarounds\nRecommended action is to upgrade to 0.8.5.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.dev/bountie",
