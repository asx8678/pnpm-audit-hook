      "description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Angular Template Compiler. The vulnerability exists because Angular’s internal sanitization schema fails to recognize the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of SVG `<script>` elements as a **Resource URL** context.\n\nIn a standard security model, attributes that can load and execute code (like a script's source) should be strictly validated. However, because the compiler does not classify these specific SVG attributes correctly",
