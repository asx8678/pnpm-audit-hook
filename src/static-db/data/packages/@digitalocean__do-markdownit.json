      "description": "### Overview\nA type confusion issue exists in the `@digitalocean/do-markdownit` package. In the `callout` and `fence_environment` plugins, the `allowedClasses` and `allowedEnvironments` options are expected to be arrays of strings. If these options are provided as a single string, the code applies `.includes` directly on the string, resulting in substring matching instead of membership checks against an array.\n\n### Affected Versions\nAll versions up to and including 1.16.1 (npm).\n\n### Impact\nSupp",
