      "description": "### Impact\n\nThis advisory addresses several LOW severity issues with streaming signed messages and restricting processing of certain types of invalid messages. \n\nThis ESDK supports a streaming mode where callers may stream the plaintext of signed messages before the ECDSA signature is validated. In addition to these signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext is verified before being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the ciphertext or decrypted plain",
