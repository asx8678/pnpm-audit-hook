This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. \n\nThis allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username.\n\nTo conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).\n\nIn fixing this we upgraded xml-crypto to v6.1.2 a",
