Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks.\n\nThis is the same bug as Moment's https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g\n\n# Workarounds\nLimit the length of the input.\n\n# References\nThere is an excellent writeup of the same issue in Moment: https:",
