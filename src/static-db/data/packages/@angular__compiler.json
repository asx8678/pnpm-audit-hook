      "description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Angular Template Compiler. The vulnerability exists because Angular’s internal sanitization schema fails to recognize the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of SVG `<script>` elements as a **Resource URL** context.\n\nIn a standard security model, attributes that can load and execute code (like a script's source) should be strictly validated. However, because the compiler does not classify these specific SVG attributes correctly",

It occurs because the compiler's internal security schema is incomplete, allowing attackers to bypass Angular's built-in security sanitization.
