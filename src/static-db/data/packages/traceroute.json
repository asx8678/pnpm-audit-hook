      "description": "The traceroute (aka node-traceroute) package through 1.0.0 for Node.js allows remote command injection via the host parameter. This occurs because the `Child.exec()` method, which is considered to be not entirely safe, is used. In particular, an OS command can be placed after a newline character.",
