      "description": "node-irc is a socket wrapper for the IRC protocol that extends Node.js' EventEmitter. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message. Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim rather than as a message to the channel.\nThe vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1.",
