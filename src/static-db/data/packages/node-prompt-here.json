The `runCommand()` is called by `getDevices()` function in file `linux/manager.js`, which is required by the `index. process.env.NM_CLI` in the file `linux/manager.js`. This function is used to construct the argument of function `execSync()`, which can be controlled by users without any sanitization.",
