If an attacker can control parts of the `path` argument to the `set` function, they could potentially modify the prototype of all objects in the JavaScript runtime, leading to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even remote code execution in some specific scenarios.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in commit [`8147abc8cfc3cfe9b9a17cd389076a5d97235a66`",
