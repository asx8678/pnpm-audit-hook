      "description": "## Context\n\nA serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain JS's `toJSON()` method (and subsequently when string-ifying objects using `JSON.stringify()`. The method did not escape objects with `'lc'` keys when serializing free-form data in kwargs. The `'lc'` key is used internally by LangChain to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure, it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than plain user data.\n\n### Attack",
