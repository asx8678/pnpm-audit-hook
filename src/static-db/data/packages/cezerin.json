      "description": "Cezerin v0.33.0 allows unauthorized order-information modification because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name when processing order requests. Hence, a malicious customer can manipulate an order (e.g., its payment status or shipping fee) by adding additional attributes to user-input during the PUT `/ajax/cart` operation for a checkout, because of `getValidDocumentForUpdate` in `api/server/services/orders/orders.js`.",
