The application passes the user-supplied githubUrl argument directly to a system shell via execSync without sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine by appending shell metacharacters to the URL.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in the src/scanner/MCPScanner.ts file within the cloneRepo method.\n\n[https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-",
