      "title": "The AuthKit React Router Library rendered sensitive auth data in HTML",
      "description": "In versions before `0.7.0`, `@workos-inc/authkit-react-router` exposed sensitive authentication artifacts — specifically `sealedSession` and `accessToken` by returning them from the `authkitLoader`. This caused them to be rendered into the browser HTML.\n\n### Impact\nThis information disclosure could lead to session hijacking in environments where cross-site scripting (XSS), malicious browser extensions, or local inspection is possible.\n \n### Patches\nPatched in [https://github.com/workos/authkit-r",
