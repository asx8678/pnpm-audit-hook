      "description": "An issue was discovered in the file-type package from 13.0.0 until 16.5.4 and 17.x before 17.1.3 for Node.js. A malformed MKV file could cause the file type detector to get caught in an infinite loop. This would make the application become unresponsive and could be used to cause a DoS attack when used on a web server.",
