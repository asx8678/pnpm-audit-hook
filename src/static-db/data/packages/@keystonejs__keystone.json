      "description": "This security advisory relates to a newly discovered capability in our query infrastructure to directly or indirectly expose the values of private fields, bypassing the configured access control.\n\nThis is an access control related oracle attack in that the attack method guides an attacker during their attempt to reveal information they do not have access to. The complexity of completing the attack is limited by some length-dependent behaviors and the fidelity of the exposed information.\n\n### Imp",
