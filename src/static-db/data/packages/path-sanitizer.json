      "description": "### Summary\nThis is a POC for a path-sanitizer [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-sanitizer). The filters can be bypassed and can result in path traversal.\n\nPayload: `..=%5c` can be used to bypass this on CLI (along with other candidates). Something similar would likely work on web apps as well. \n\n### PoC\nHere's the code to test for the filter bypass:\n\n```js\nconst sanitize = require(\"path-sanitizer\")\nconst path = require(\"path\")\nconst fs = require(\"fs\")\n\n// Real scenario:\nfunction ",
