      "description": "Due to a bug in sandboxing logic, `sandbox-runtime` did not properly enforce a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains. This could allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox. A patch for this was released in v0.0.16. \n\nThank you to https://github.com/bendrucker for reporting this issue!",
