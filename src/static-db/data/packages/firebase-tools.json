      "description": "This vulnerability was a potential CSRF attack. When running the Firebase emulator suite, there is an export endpoint that is used normally to export data from running emulators.

We recommend upgrading past version 13.6.0 or [commit 068a2b08dc308c7ab4b569617f5fc8821237e3a0](https://github.com/fire",
