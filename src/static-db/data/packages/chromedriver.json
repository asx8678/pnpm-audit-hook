This could lead to unauthorized access and potentially malicious actions on the host system.\n\n**Note:**\n\nAn attacker must have access to the system running the vulnerable chromedriver library to exploit it. The success of exploitation also depends on the permissions and privileges of the process running chromedriver. ",
