      "description": "### Impact\nApplications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected.\n\n### Description\nThe Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. \n\n",
