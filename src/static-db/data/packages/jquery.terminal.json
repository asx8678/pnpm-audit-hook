      "description": "### Impact\nThis is low impact and limited XSS, because code for XSS payload is always visible, but attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees.\n\nAlso if the application use execHash option and execute code from URL the attacker can use this URL to execute his code. The scope is limited because the javascript code inside html attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible.\n\n### Patches\nFixed version 2.31.1\n\n### Worka",
