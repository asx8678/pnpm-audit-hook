      "description": "## Impact\n\nThe `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author.\n\n## Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` packa",
