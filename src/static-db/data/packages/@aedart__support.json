      "description": "### Impact\n\nPossible prototype pollution for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package.\n\nThe likelihood is questionable, given that a class' metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can become a vulnerability.\n### Patches\n\nHas been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n",
